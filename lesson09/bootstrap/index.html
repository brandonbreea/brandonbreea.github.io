                        <p> My hobbies include playing golf, juggling, going for hikes, and anything else that helps me
                            get
                            outdoors! I enjoy keeping active and practice yoga and exercise several times a week. I also
                            like to get together with friends, try new beers at local breweries, and travel. I
                            studied Physics in college, therefore I also enjoy keeping current with what is happening in
                            the world of science and technology.
